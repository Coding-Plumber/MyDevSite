      <h1>Exploring Ergonomic Split Keyboards: My Journey with the Glove 80</h1>
<p>Over the last few months, I started to look into ergonomic split keyboards and a few keyboards kept coming up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kinesis Advantage 360</li>
  <li>Glove 80</li>
  <li>ZSA Moonlander</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Though?</h2>
<p>As a self-employed plumber who also works as a software engineer, I began noticing fatigue in my wrists. After a decade of repetitive movements like using screwdrivers, I started to worry about carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). I researched ways to prevent this because I really enjoy my job and wanted to plan for longevity. I came across an article that seems to corroborate this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pubmed">PubMed research on ergonomic keyboards</a></p>
<p>The research suggests that fixed-split ergonomic keyboards can reduce pain and the likelihood of developing musculoskeletal disorders in typists over extended use. It seems that the forced position of a normal keyboard can increase muscle strain, whereas an ergonomic or split ergonomic keyboard can alleviate this.</p>
<h2>Glove 80</h2>

</p>
<p>The Glove 80 caught my eye. They kind of look like goalkeeper gloves to me every time I take a step back and look at them.</p>
<p>I decided on the Glove 80 because of its excellent reviews. Some complaints mentioned they're better suited for larger hands, which worked in my favor as I was worried about the opposite.</p>

</p>
<p>It has a natural curve and feels incredibly comfortable. You can even 'tent' it, raising the legs to a 45-degree angle, a 90-degree angle, or attach it to your chair with accessories.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>The Glove 80 is fairly expensive, costing me Â£322. However, you pay for what you get, and can you put a price on your health? As a plumber, I always bought high-quality tools, and this keyboard feels well-made. It has reignited my enjoyment of typing and motivated me to relearn touch typing.</p>
<p>It comes in two colors (white or dark gray) and offers 4 key choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kailh Choc v1 Brown Tactile</li>
  <li>Kailh Choc v1 Red Linear 50gf</li>
  <li>Kailh Choc v1 Red Pro Linear 35gf</li>
  <li>Kailh Choc v1 White clicky</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also order one with unsoldered keys if you have soldering experience and prefer custom keys.</p>
<h2>QWERTY & Engram</h2>
<p>This is where I probably messed up a little. After 20 years of using QWERTY, I decided to explore alternative layouts while switching keyboards.</p>
<h3>Why is QWERTY the way it is?</h3>
<p>QWERTY was introduced in 1873 for the Remington No. 1 typewriter. Its design was influenced by mechanical limitations, primarily to reduce jamming of typebars. The layout arranged commonly used letters apart to slow down typing just enough to prevent jams.</p>
<h3>Alternative Layouts</h3>
<p>I researched several alternative layouts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dvorak (1930):</strong> Designed to increase typing speed and reduce finger movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Colemak (2006):</strong> Aims to retain many QWERTY shortcuts while placing common letters on the home row.</li>
  <li><strong>Workman (2010):</strong> Focuses on reducing lateral finger movements and finger strain.</li>
  <li><strong>Engram (2016):</strong> An ergonomic layout optimized using computer algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up trying a slightly altered version of Engram by Sunak. It places less-used characters like 'Z' and 'Q' on the little finger. You can find Sunak's review and layout article <a href="https://sunaku.github.io/moergo-glove80-keyboard.html#lower-layer">here</a>.</p>

</p>
<h2>My Typing Progress</h2>
<p>Here's how my typing speed progressed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Week 1: 15 WPM</li>
  <li>Week 2: 25 WPM</li>
  <li>Week 3: 30 WPM</li>
  <li>Week 4: 35 WPM</li>
</ul>
<p>After a few months, I can now touch type at around 65 WPM and have started working on increasing my speed again.</p>
<h2>Last Thoughts</h2>
<p>I'm thrilled with the change. Since switching, I haven't experienced any wrist pain or fatigue, and typing has become fun again.</p>
<p>One last thing: when I got my split keyboard and changed layouts, I also decided to switch to Vim. Learning a new layout and Vim simultaneously was challenging and slowed me down initially. However, now that I'm past the learning curve, it was a great decision, and I love the shortcuts and skills I've gained.</p>

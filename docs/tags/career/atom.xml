      <description>These are some thoughts from my own experience of changing careers - hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll help if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about making the switch yourself.&#xA;Signs you might need a change I talked about why I changed careers in my previous post, but here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap of the signs that told me I needed something different:&#xA;Found myself just going through the motions each day Lost my drive for the work Stopped caring about learning new techniques in my field Every day started feeling like a slow day This may sound like you, and you may not need a new career as such, maybe just a new environment could be what you need.</description>

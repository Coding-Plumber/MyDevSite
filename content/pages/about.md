title: About
---

I am a full stack self taught software engineer. Before this i worked as a self employed Plumber which i still occasionally do.

### Why did you change career i hear you ask? 

It got to a point where i was getting bored, I've always been somebody who enjoys their job (really) and as i got better at the plumbing problems the less challenging they became the more bored i got. I looked into creating a website for myself which led me to https://www.theodinproject.com/ which led onto northcoders bootcamp to eventually working in my current software role.


### The purpose of this site?

It will be mainly for me to keep track on things i do, to see my growth and showcase my work. I will write about anything i am interested in which is mostly going to be about tech. Maybe some tech construction crossovers?


### My strongest languages

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Golang
- React


### Any questions?

Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions, be it your in construction and thinking of making the switch or want to ask me on advice to fix your leaky tap? Email me on codingPlumber@gmail.com.

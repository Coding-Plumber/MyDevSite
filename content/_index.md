I'm Kyle, I work as a software engineer and occasionally as a plumber.

I have committed to writing atleast 100 posts to help me write and help solidify my learning. These could be on anything i find interesting or am learning from coding, tech maybe even a little bit of construction or DIY. Let's see where it goes.
